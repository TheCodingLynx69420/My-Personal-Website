            <h1>ABOUT LYNX:</h1>
            <p>Lynx (also known as Coding lynx) is a student of web development, his journey of becoming a coder started at when he was a "Commerce/Business Studies" student in his college </p>

            <p>Time by Time his interest in business studies was getting less, and he decided to learn about coding because he was always curious about it. he didnt know anything about coding (not even how to output "hello world" using a programming language) because his school never actually taught about coding (education system problem) yet he decided to take this path. </p>

            <p>At first he started his journey by learning Python it was hard at first because it was a completely new experience for him in this field but using Youtube as a guide he learned python with ease</p>

            <p>Later he researched a lot about goals in coding (app development, game development etc)
               and decided to go for "game development" first, he developed 3 games using Python but was pretty dissatisfied because it was very hard for him to make high quality games
               (yeah skill issue or whatever) it was not his niche</p>

            <p>He then later decided to try out web developed and guess what? he enjoyed making Websites! and then thats how he decided to take a course for web development in coding and try to become a big developer.</p>
